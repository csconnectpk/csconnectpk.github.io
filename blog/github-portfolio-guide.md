## Code Quality Best Practices

### Clean Code Principles

#### 1. Naming Conventions
```javascript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const u = users.filter(x => x.age > 18);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const adultUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 18);
```

#### 2. Function Structure
```python
# Bad
def process_data(data):
    # 50 lines of complex logic
    return result

# Good
def process_data(data):
    validated_data = validate_input(data)
    cleaned_data = clean_data(validated_data)
    processed_data = transform_data(cleaned_data)
    return processed_data

def validate_input(data):
    # validation logic

def clean_data(data):
    # cleaning logic

def transform_data(data):
    # transformation logic
```

#### 3. Error Handling
```javascript
// Bad
const user = await User.findById(userId);
const posts = user.posts;

// Good
try {
    const user = await User.findById(userId);
    if (!user) {
        throw new Error('User not found');
    }
    const posts = user.posts || [];
    return posts;
} catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to fetch user posts:', error);
    throw error;
}
```

project-name/
│
├── client/                 # Frontend code
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
│
├── server/                 # Backend code
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── middleware/
│   └── package.json
│
├── docs/                   # Documentation

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes

#### 1. Committing Sensitive Information
```bash
# Always add to .gitignore
.env
node_modules/
*.log
config/database.yml
aws-credentials.json
```

#### 2. Poor Commit Messages
```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "changes"

# Good
git commit -m "Fix authentication error for expired tokens"
git commit -m "Add pagination to user list endpoint"
git commit -m "Update README with installation instructions"
```

#### 3. Lack of Error Handling
Every project should include:
- Input validation
- Error boundaries (for React apps)
- Try-catch blocks for async operations
- User-friendly error messages

### Presentation Mistakes

#### 1. Broken Links
Before sharing your portfolio:
- Test all live demo links
- Verify GitHub repository access
- Check image links in README files
- Ensure contact information is current

#### 2. Incomplete Projects
Better to have 4 complete projects than 8 half-finished ones:
- All features should work as described
- No obvious bugs in main functionality
- Professional-looking UI/UX
- Complete documentation

#### 3. No Personal Projects
Avoid portfolios that only show:
- University assignments
- Tutorial follow-alongs
- Cloned repositories without modifications
